When I first began my digital marketing career, I started as a solo freelancer. I worked directly with small businesses helping them with their local SEO, email marketing, website design and copy, etc.

Eventually, I was given the opportunity to work for a small marketing agency, essentially doing the same things. I wasn't especially fond of finding new clients, to begin with, so the idea of working for an agency that already did the work to get the client sounded very appealing. I only had to deal with fulfillment which was a load off compared to being a solo freelancer where you have to do everything.

So how did it go?

I stayed with that agency for almost 2 years. I learned a lot working in that position and I wouldn't take it back for anything. In the end though, I decided going back to being a solo freelancer gave me more control over my life and therefore more happiness. Not to mention, I make a lot more money on an hourly basis than I did at the agency. A lot of this has to do with me switching from hourly billing to fixed-price billing, which is hard to do if you're working for an agency that pays on an hourly basis.

This has allowed me to spend more time building up my own business assets, like my blog, ebooks, products, etc. In the long run, these assets will allow me to work less while simultaneously making more money. 

In the long run, I could eventually turn this into my own agency and hire other people but I'm not sure I ever want to grow that large.

If you're given the same opportunity and you're on the fence about it, I'd say give it a shot! It doesn't have to be permanent, and you can learn a lot in the process. You may find that you like working for an agency more than being a solo freelancer. You really won't know until you try!
