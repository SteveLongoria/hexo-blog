You've officially set-up your first Google Ad campaign, now your off to the races right? Not so fast! After filling out your new Google Ad campaign's settings, you need to create your first ad group for that new campaign.

This is where most newbs will create one ad group, add a bajillion keywords , and create one ad for them all. This is a bad move!

You want your ad groups to be tightly themed together. How so?

Say you're selling golf clubs. Putters and drivers to be specific. Instead of lumping both 'putter' and 'driver' keywords into one ad group, you'd want to create 2 ad groups; one for 'putters' and one for 'drivers'.

Why?

This ensures the more targeted ad is served when users search for 'golf putters' or 'golf drivers' on Google. What do I mean by 'more targeted'? 

Well, for example, say somebody searches for 'putters' in Google. By creating a dedicated ad group for 'putters', you can make sure they see an ad that talks about 'putters' instead of 'drivers'. This creates a higher clickthru rate for your ad and will therefore will generate better results.

The same is true for making a dedicated ad group for 'drivers'.

You can also send them to a more targeted landing page dealing specifically with 'putters' or 'drivers, depending on what they're searching for'. 

So get out there and create more organized ad groups that are tightly themed together, and be sure to only put 25-30 keywords per ad group max. If you find one ad group is starting to fill up beyond that, it's time to see if you can break it up into 2 separate, more focused ad groups.
