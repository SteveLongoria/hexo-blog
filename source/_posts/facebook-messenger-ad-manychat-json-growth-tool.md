The other day I wrote [a blog post about what I think is the best Facebook Messenger Ad strategy](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/08/05/best-facebook-messenger-marketing-strategy/). Today I'm writing 'Part I' of what will be a small '2-part' blog post series showing you how to get started with the [Facebook Messenger Ad strategy](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/08/05/best-facebook-messenger-marketing-strategy/) by setting up a Facebook Messenger Ad Campaign using the [ManyChat](https://manychat.com) JSON Growth Tool.

Ready? Let's get to work!

Login to your ManyChat account and click on “Growth Tools” in the left hand side:

Then click the blue “+ New Growth Tool” button:

Enter a name for this particular Growth Tool. For example, ‘Ad Campaign #1’:

![Bidding](/content/manychatimg3.jpg)

Now select the “Facebook Ads JSON” widget type that is under the ‘Other Growth Tools’ section:

We’ll then find ourselves on this screen:

## Customize Your ManyChat Opt-in Message

By default, when subscribers opt-in to your Messenger via Facebook Messenger Ad, they'd see this generic opt-in message shown above:

"Welcome! Thank you for being interested in our product! The next post about it is coming soon, stay tuned!

Are you interested in having a discount?"

We want to override this and create our own opt-in message. To do this, simply click on the "edit" link under "Opt-in Message":

You"ll then arrive on a screen like this:

Go ahead and click in the text box in the middle of the screen to edit the default message:

I changed to this just for this examples sake:

This blog post is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on ManyChat optin messages and follow-ups. You're going to want to [read over DeadlineFunnel's documentation](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/525-how-to-integrate-deadline-funnel-with-manychat) on how to setup an 'evergreen' limited-time offer Messenger sequence like I talk about in [this post](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/08/05/best-facebook-messenger-marketing-strategy/).

Moving on, the next thing I'd like to show you is that you can easily change the call to action on the button by just clicking on it:

You can also tag the subscriber by clicking on "+Action" button and adding a tag:

After you got the opt-in message all set, go and and click the blue "publish" button in the top right corner:

![Bidding](/content/manychatimg12.jpg)

Now go back to your Growth Tool by clicking on the name at the top of the page. Mine is named "Example". 

After you click, you should find yourself back on the JSON Growth Tool page:

That's it! Next, all we need to do is set up the Facebook Messenger Ad Campaign and sync it up with our ManyChat JSON. I'll be walking you through this in Part II of this post coming soon!
