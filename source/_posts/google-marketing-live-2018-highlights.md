They don't happen to comment on the [growing issue of ad fraud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/07/26/reality-check-is-ad-fraud-up-or-down/#12dac6bd16d0), which is why I still don't recommend Display Ads for those with a limited budget:

"<em>Adobe inspected traffic across thousands of its client sites and found that 28% of the traffic showed “non-human signals” indicating that it was fraudulent. Bob Hoffman of The Ad Contrarian calculated, based on this fact, that ad fraud may reach $66 billion in 2018, which is 10 times more than the $6.5 billion predicted for 2017 by the ANA.</em>"

Google supposedly reimburses any clicks it considers to be click fraud but how can we be sure how accurate they are?

I realize Google Search Ads aren't perfect either but click fraud has generally been more of a problem with banner ads showing on display networks than it has on the Google search engine. Also, I've personally seen the results of a successful Google Search Ad campaign, so I know the traffic is mostly real.

It'll be interesting to see if new players in the space like [Brave](https://brave.com) & [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org) can help make display network ads work again for publishers and advertisers.
