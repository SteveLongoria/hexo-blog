As a freelance Google Ad Manager, it may be tempting to offer Google Ad audits at no charge, effectively serving as a 'loss leader' to help you get your foot in the door and get a sale. It's especially tempting when first starting out and you're hungry for clients.

_Is this a good idea?_

No, I don't think so. I believe one should always charge for custom solutions, even if it's a small sum to start with. You can always raise the price as your services become more in demand. Any quality client won't have a problem with this and they understand that you get what you pay for.

As a freelancer, you can waste a lot of time offering free audits and time is what you need to safeguard the most. We all only have the same 24 hours in the day.

In my opinion, you should never do custom work for free. People don't value free work and this strategy typically attracts 'tire kickers' or low-value clients that will end up being more hassle than they're worth.

Every Google Ad Campaign is different and truly analyzing a campaign to see how they can optimize it takes a lot of time and energy. It also offers a lot of value. So remember, never sell yourself short. Know what you're worth and don't be scared to charge.

Instead of offering a free audit, offer a free downloadable '[lead magnet][1]' of some kind that you can offer for free to get your fit in the door. This way you can automate the delivery, which means it's a lot more scalable, and once set up, it doesn't require any more time from you.

This can achieve the same purpose while saving you a lot of time. It allows you to deliver value and build trust so you can eventually close the sale.

So the sales funnel would look like this:

Lead magnet (free) > audit ($X) > monthly management ($X/mo)
