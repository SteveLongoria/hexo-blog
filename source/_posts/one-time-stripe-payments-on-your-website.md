You want to be able to process just a simple one-time payment for your product using Stripe but you have no clue how to do it. 

You tried reading their documentation but you're having trouble understanding it because let's be honest, you're NOT a web developer!

Unfortunately, you're probably going to have to learn a little bit about entering commands into your computer terminal and some HTML & JavaScript to implement Stripe Payments on your site.

I highly recommend going through [this free online web development course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) for beginners. Don't forget to go through the 'server-side' NodeJS lessons and tutorials as well. After you're finished with that go ahead and dive back into the [Stripe Payments Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/quickstart). It should start making sense after that!

After you get it up and running just don't forget to switch out your Stripe Development API Keys for your Production API Keys before deploying.
