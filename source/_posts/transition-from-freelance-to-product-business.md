Having to always put in hours in order to get a paycheck. Freelancing isn't all that different than having a job or running a service based business. If you stop putting in the hours, you stop getting paid, immediately. 

A product business may take longer to build up but isn't so reliant on you putting in x hours of work per day. This is because there is strength in numbers. If your income is spread out amongst many customers paying say $20-30/mo on average, it doesn't matter as much if you lose a customer here or there. 

On the flip side, if you are a freelancer, it's likely you have most of your income spread across a lot fewer customers. If you lost a client, it represents a bigger chunk of your income and therefore it hurts a lot more!

I always like to say, if you live by the whale, you'll die by the whale!

I don't know about you but I'd rather have the former situation, which is why I'm dedicating more time these days to developing my product business further. This way I can help more people while building the kind of lifestyle I want to live.
