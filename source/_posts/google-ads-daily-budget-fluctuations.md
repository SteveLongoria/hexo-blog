You probably have noticed that sometimes your daily Google Ad budget is sometimes exceeded. Why is Google Ads not respecting your daily budget and overspending?

It's usually due to the fact that the Google Ad auction is in real time and sometimes more clicks can occur than expected. For example, if you're just under your daily budget say by $5 and two clicks come through almost simultaneously that cost you $5 a piece, that will end up putting you over your budget by $5. After you exceed your daily budget however, your ad shouldn't be shown anymore for any keywords until the next day.

You just need to account for this when you set your daily budget. Just know the daily budget is not a hard and fast rule and it may be exceeded a little bit on any given day due to the natural fluctuation of the cost per click.
