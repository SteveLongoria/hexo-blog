So you want to accept Bitcoin on your website for your product or service and you're thinking about using [Coingate](https://coingate.com/) but you're not sure if it's the right choice!

I gave Coingates 'Buy Button' a shot when launching [my last ebook](https://stevelongoria.net/gadadvantage/) because it had a slick checkout interface that also included the option for [Lightning Network Payments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), which is the 2nd layer scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables ultra fast payments at only a fraction of a cent in fees.

I announced the launch of my ebook on [/r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) since that sub-reddit loves hearing of new merchants that are accepting Bitcoin for payment, especially if you're offering a 15% off discount.

I got a sale from a Bitcoin enthusiast and here's where I run into an issue with Coingate. They have a minimum withdrawal limit, meaning unless I had a minimum of  0.01 of Bitcoin in my account, I wasn't able to withdrawal it. This isn't a huge deal as it's only $38 USD worth as of this writing but my problem is that the limit exists at all! Why can't I simply withdrawal my bits to my wallet of choice no matter the amount?

When I set up Bitcoin payments in the future I'll probably set up a custom solution. Not your keys not your coins after all right?
