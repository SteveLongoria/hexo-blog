When starting a new blog many want to know the fastest or best way to get their new blog posts indexed by Google. They don't want to miss out on that sweet organic Google traffic and I don't blame them.

Fortunately, it's not necessary to submit each new blog post to Google in order to have it indexed. You want to create and submit a sitemap once via your [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) and Google will regularly crawl your sitemap looking for new links and content.

The [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) will even tell you the last time it crawled your sitemap and how many pages it has indexed so you can make sure Google is indexing all of your URLs. It's really sweet!

Now go forth and make sure you have your blogs sitemap submitted in your [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
