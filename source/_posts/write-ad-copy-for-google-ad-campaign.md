You've gone through the basic Google Ad campaign settings, you've got a short list of 20-30 keywords for an ad group and it's now time to write ad copy!

The main thing to remember is that the closer your ad copy matches the search query of the user who clicks on your ad, the better the conversion rate will typically be. You'll also want to send them ideally to a landing page with the same copy above the fold. This is what is referred to as 'message match' in the search engine marketing world.

This is why it's important to have ad groups that contain keywords that are tightly themed together.

Google is in the business of providing the most relevant search results possible to its users. If you can help them do their job better by serving more relevant ad copy and landing page copy to their users, you'll be rewarded with a higher quality score, higher conversion rate and a lower cost per click over time.

With that said, I've had ads with relatively poor quality scores and 'message match' still generate a positive ROI. At the end of the day, it's not what you're paying per click, after all, it's how much your return on ad spend is.

So go forth and start experimenting! You'll want to test out at least 2-3 different versions of your ad from the get-go because you never know which one will outperform the other. As you notice certain winning ads emerge, you should pause the failing ads and test new copy based on the winning ads.
