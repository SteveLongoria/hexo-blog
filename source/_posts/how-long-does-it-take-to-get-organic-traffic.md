This is a common question asked by many people when they create their first website or blog. The answer varies quite a bit obviously because every website is different.

Typically though it can take about 3-5 months to start getting organic Google traffic to a new website or blog.

I just started a new blog after a 3-4 year hiatus. I didn't know what to expect since it had been so long since I've blogged or tried to get organic traffic. After publishing roughly 3 blog posts the first month and 3 the second month, I started getting organic google traffic! Just make sure to create a sitemap and submit it via the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to get indexed ASAP.

Here are my Google Search Console statistics for this blog over the first 6 months:

The more you blog the better, especially when first starting out. Just commit for the long term and start writing! :)
