Google Ads and Google Analytics can be pretty confusing, to say the least. It doesn't help that Google's documentation is fairly technical and doesn't do a good job of giving you the '[ELI5](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ELI5)' or '[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)' versions.

So should you enable Google Ads auto-tagging and sync Google Analytics with Google Ads? 

Yes because it'll give you additional insights inside your Google Analytics on the traffic you're getting from Adwords. 

One of the biggest benefits is being able to track 'offline sales' back to the keyword and ad level in your Google Ad campaign. I talk more about that [here in this blog post](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/10/08/offline-sales-conversion-google-ad-calls/). It's a really powerful way to optimize your Google Ad campaign to maximize your return on investment.

You'll also be able to sync Google Ads with Google Optimize after you sync it with Google Analytics. This is supposed to give you additional insights on your Google Optimize experiments like which ad did better with which a/b variation.
