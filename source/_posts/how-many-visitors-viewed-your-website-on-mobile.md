Now, if only you could find out how many visitors are viewed your website on their mobile device. This type of insight can be really useful as it can inform whether or not you should have a 'mobile-first design' or 'desktop first' design. 

You can also see how many of these visitors are taking action on your Google Analytic Goals. Maybe mobile visitors are giving you your best conversion rate, maybe desktop users are. You don't know if you never look at the data!
