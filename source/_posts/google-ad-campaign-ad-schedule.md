Another big decision you have to make when setting up your Google Search Ad campaign is determining what your ad schedule should be! 

Most will simply set up a one-time block for all days of the week, or M-F 9am-5pm if you're a 'brick and mortar' business. This is a mistake because what most people don't realize is that the more granular you setup your ad schedule, the more granular you can make bid adjustments down the road. Why is this important? It's important for maximizing a campaign's return on investment.

Here's a better example of how you should set up your ad schedule.

By setting it up like this you'll be able to change your bid for say the 8am-11am time block on Monday or the 11am-2pm time block on Tuesday. Why would you want to do that? Well, it just happens to be a crucial step in maximizing your campaign's return on investment over time! 

You see, once your campaign starts generating conversions, you'll begin to see patterns emerge. You'll see that your campaign generates a lower cost per lead or sale on certain days or a certain time of day.

So you can start to bid more aggressively during the days and time of day you're generating your best return on investment. On the reverse, you can bid less aggressively on the days and time of day where you don't generate a great return on investment.

If you don't set up your ad schedule as granular as possible, you limit these bid adjustment opportunities and you don't want to do that!

See how important everything is when setting up your Google Ad campaign? Now get out there and get granular!
