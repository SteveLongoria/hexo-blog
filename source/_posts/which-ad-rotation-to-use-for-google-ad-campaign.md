When setting up your Google Search Ad campaign you have to decide how to rotate your ads in the 'ad rotation' section of the campaign setup process. 

It looks like this in the new Google Ad interface:

I always recommend selecting the “Do not optimize: Rotate ads indefinitely” option. Why? I don't like leaving any of the decision making to Google's automated algorithms. I simply want Google to rotate through all of my ad variations equally and then, I'll manually pause ads based on performance myself. 

As a general rule of thumb, if the setting is "recommended" by Google it's really designed to maximize their ROI not yours. Call me crazy but this is how I manage my Google Search Ad campaigns and it's always generated great results for me.
