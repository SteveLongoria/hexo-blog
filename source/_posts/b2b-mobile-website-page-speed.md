Everyone says you need your website to be blazing fast on mobile. There's just no limit to how fast you should make it. If it can load in 1ms then do it. This is because many mobile phone users are still on 3g internet speeds. A [study conducted by OpenSignal](https://www.opensignal.com/2019/12/18/how-to-hasten-us-3g-switch-off-to-accelerate-5g) revealed that roughly 20% of Americans still use 3g internet, and that was published in 2019.

[Google has also made it known](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) that page speed has an impact on your mobile rank in the SERPs.

Unfortunately, if you take this advice to extremes you're likely to have a website that resembles a text document more than a website that exists in 2020. 

Don't believe me? Checkout out [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). 

It's literally the fastest loading blog you can create, but it's also very barebones in the design department.

Is your B2B audience even using mobile devices to search for your content? There's [a lot of stats](https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/mobile-seo/mobile-retail-search-trends-for-b2b-and-b2c/) out there showing mobile beating desktop when it comes to B2C audiences, which makes sense, but what about B2B?

If you're targeting a professional B2B audience then you'll likely find that mobile accounts for a much smaller percentage of your web traffic. This is because professional business people still prefer conducting research and doing their work on desktop and laptop computers.

Here's the breakdown for my website:

This is likely to be the situation for the foreseeable future. I can see a percentage of the B2B audience adopting bigger tablets like the iPad Pro to conduct their work but most will likely still opt for a full desktop or laptop.

This means mobile page speed and mobile SEO isn’t as important for you since most of your audience will be using powerful computers with faster internet to access your website. And since [Google SERPs can differ by up 79%](https://www.51blocks.com/the-difference-between-googles-desktop-mobile-algorithms/) when comparing mobile devices with desktop computers, it's possible to still rank well in Google Desktop SERPs even if you don't rank well in Google's Mobile SERPs.

With that said, you still want your website to load as fast as possible without sacrificing design too much. You also still want to make sure you have a mobile version of your website (i.e. responsive website). Just like with everything in life, it's about striking a balance.
