Is your local business struggling to get traffic from Google? Many small business owners wonder if they should hire an SEO specialist to help them boost their ranking in Google.

This can cost you hundreds of dollars, maybe even thousands depending on how many months you retain their services. Definitely not a small investment.

*So is it worth it?*

I'd say no and in some cases these SEO specialists can do more harm than good. There's so many different tactics they employ that it's hard to give a blanket statement on all of them. The fact of the matter is employing SEO best practices isn't hard and that's all they can really do for your business anyways. 

That's right, there is no secret hack that they can use to get you that coveted #1 spot on Google. Google wouldn't be the king of search if any joker can rank whatever website or page anywhere he wants in [the SERPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page).
