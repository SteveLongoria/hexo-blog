These days it's very important that your website loads fast on desktop and mobile devices. Your page speed has a [huge impact on your SEO](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) and [conversion rates](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/), so it's not something to gloss over. In this increasingly competitive world, it's going to be crucial to optimize website performance to achieve a competitive advantage.

With this in mind, should you use Wordpress as your website and blogging platform? Is Wordpress the fastest blogging platform available?

The answer these days is no! Not by a long shot. You can optimize your Wordpress site to load in less than 3 seconds, this is true. You'll likely have to hire a specialist or pay for a special plugin, but that's neither here nor there.

The thing is, these days you'll achieve 1 second load times or less 'out of the box' by using something called a 'static site generator' for your website and blog. The most popular are the following:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) 
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

This blog is built using Hexo but if I were to create a new blog today I'd probably use Hugo as it seems to have more themes available.

*Why are these so much faster than Wordpress?*

The answer to this gets a little technical but I'll try and provide the simplest explanation possible!

Wordpress is a dynamic site with a database. When you load a Wordpress page, it has to fetch the content from the database and fill in the template with the content. With a static site generator when you load a page, the content is already there and it loads up right away without having to fetch it from a database. This is referred to as being a 'static site'.

This means that if all things are equal, there's no way a Wordpress site could load faster than a static site. Not if they both were optimized to the max. I don't see it happening.

I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but most Wordpress sites I encounter take 5+ seconds to load. :)
