Organic Google traffic is one of the best sources of traffic for any blog. Which is why it's important to choose a blogging platform that that will help you rank higher in the Google SERPs.

Wordpress is the most popular blogging platform out there by far. In fact, as of this writing roughly 34% of all websites are run by Wordpress. Is it the best for getting that sweet organic Google traffic though? Is it the best if you're concerned about your SEO?

I argue no. I already wrote about how [Wordpress is not the fastest blogging platform](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/08/24/is-wordpress-fastest-blogging-platform/). Well, it just so happens that page speed is now a huge ranking factor to rank high up in the Google SERPs. Granted, it's not the only ranking factor but I believe it to be one of the bigger ones. 

Google cares a lot about the user experience and it only makes sense that they'd want the fastest loading sites (that also offer the best content) to rank in the top of the SERPs.

I'll be the first to say that I'm no SEO wizard. I probably can't help you rank for some super competitive keyword. With that said, my blog's organic Google traffic is still trending up. So far, in my experience, if you just focus on publishing the best content possible while having a blog with fast load time, it's enough to consistently grow your Google traffic over time.

Here's what my organic Google traffic looks like for this blog to date.

It's only about a year old and as of this writing, you can see my traffic continues to trend up as do my rankings.

So what blog platform should you use to ensure fast page speed? I recommend either Hugo, Hexo or Gatsby.
