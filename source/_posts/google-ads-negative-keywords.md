Sometimes you're not quite sure if you should add a given search term as a negative keyword to your Google Ads campaign. Most of the time it's obvious when a keyword doesn't relate to your product or service, but then other times not so much. Especially when you're not sure what the search term means exactly. 

When this happens, the best thing to do is to search the term in question in Google and see what pages Google thinks is relevant to the search term. If the pages that rank on the top are irrelevant to your product or service, then it's a safe bet including it as a negative keyword on your campaign because the majority of the people searching this term are not going to be interested in what you have to offer.

If, on the other hand, the pages that rank on the top are relevant to your offering, not only should you NOT add it as a negative keyword but you should consider creating a new ad group around that new keyword to test out using ads that include that search term in the ad copy.

Now don't just sit there, go and implement this strategy and let me know if it lowers your cost per conversion/sale.
