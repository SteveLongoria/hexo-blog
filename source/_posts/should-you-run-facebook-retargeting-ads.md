When deciding on whether or not your business should run Facebook Ads, the first question you must answer is, "What kind of Facebook Ad?".

Facebook has several different ad types and it can get confusing and overwhelming. I made a post already about [my thoughts on running Facebook Ads for a B2B businesses](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/11/27/should-you-use-facebook-ads-for-b2b/).

I happened to share this post also with the [/r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/a9l4zp/should_you_use_facebook_ads_for_b2b/) community and a couple commenters disagreed with my stance on Facebook Retargeting Ads, saying how retargeting ads for them have 'generated stupid high roi'.

This may very well be the case for now but [public perception of online privacy is changing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/). 

A business that does not respect its website visitor's privacy may eventually find themselves in the midst of a backlash. 

To add to this, browsers like [Safari](https://www.macobserver.com/link/how-the-newest-safari-browser-blocks-ad-tracking/), [Chrome](https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/15/technology/google-chrome-ad-blocking/index.html), [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) and even [Fire Fox](https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-mozilla-is-purging-ad-trackers) are starting to have various levels of ad blocking and ad tracker blocking on by default for users.

[Installs of various ad tracker blockers are only trending upwards](https://www.emarketer.com/content/demanding-a-better-ad-experience)!

This is because ad trackers and ad retargeting campaigns only help to contribute to 'internet bloat' and cause websites to load slower. It gives the average user a poor user experience when browsing the web. 

Obviously, the more people blocking ad trackers means the effectiveness of your retargeting ad campaign will eventually begin to diminish.

As you can see, there is definitely a growing business case for removing all ad trackers from your site. If you care about 'future proofing' your business and marketing plan, you'll figure out how to market your business without using ad trackers and ad retargeting campaigns.

At the end of the day, there's plenty of profits to be had for businesses that want to take the 'high road' by respecting their website visitors privacy. Besides, do you like slow loading websites? Do you like seeing ads following you around everywhere? Do you like your online privacy being violated? Probably not. Let's be the change we want to see in the world and profit at the same time.
