Have you installed website analytics yet? It seems like you have every digital marketing specialist telling you to install website analytics. "You must be crazy not have to analytics", they probably tell you.

Here's the thing though, I agree with them!

"Okay, fair enough!" you say. You don't need your arm twisted, if the pros say to install website analytics like Google Analytics or something similar, then you should do it right? Sure, but this doesn't tell you what website analytics allow you to do! That's what you're dying to know!

It's really quite simple...

*'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it'* - [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)

Yes, the first rule in marketing and business! You must be able to accurately measure or track the results of all your marketing efforts. If you don't do this, then you'll never know how to improve upon your marketing efforts, or in other words, you won't really know truly what marketing efforts are generating the best results for you and which aren't.

This brings us back to website analytics. If you don't know which traffic sources, or which pages of your website are generating the most sales or email optins for your business, you won't be able to improve upon it overtime. 

Without website analytics you'll effectively be driving aimlessly in the dark and that's rather dangerous. :)

Go and install website analytics right now! The most popular is obviously Google Analytics and the one I have most experience with.
