Should you get a job and work in-house or should you go freelance? This is the question I was constantly asking for the past several years. I've been in digital marketing for over 10 years now and for the bulk of that time, I've worked as a freelancer technically.

Most of the time I'd have just one client that I devoted 30-40 hour per week to. As you can see, this is basically a job without the benefits. I had struggled finding a regular source of clients for years. I tried a little bit of everything. Some of it worked and some of it didn't. Eventually, I started getting more clients and getting better at keeping my pipeline full.

Still, I couldn't stop wondering if maybe I should try out working in-house for a change, you know a 'real job'. So late last year I decided, 'What the hell!?' and gave it a go. I got hired at a local tech company as a digital marketer. It was the first in-house position I had in quite sometime. It wasn't meant to be though because the pandemic hit a few months later and I was laid off.

Instead of waiting around for unemployment that may never materialize, I just got straight to work. I started hitting up my usual channels online for getting freelance work and to my surprise I started getting more clients than I ever had.

Part of the reason I believe is due to the pandemic. Most businesses and professionals are taking their online presence more seriously and re-examining their online strategy. Since that's the type of services I provide, I've seen an uptick in business.

I've also started to dial in my marketing and sales strategy. Which has allowed me to close more leads. This has helped a lot as well.

Anyways... fast forward to today, I just had a great meeting with a prospect and I closed the deal. You get such a rush with sales and working as a solo freelancer, that I don't know if I could ever go back to working in-house.

A lot of people consider a regular 9-5 job, working in-house for a company, to be the most stable and secure situation you can be in. They wonder how freelancers deal with income volatility.

That's not the way I see it. When you're working for one company, in-house, you risk being let go and being left with zero income. For a freelancer that has several clients, losing a couple clients is not that big of a deal. They still have some income.

For this reason, I consider a freelance business to be more secure so long as you have enough clients and know how to find more whenever you need to.

Another perk is you get to set your own schedule and rules for communication. If a client doesn't respect it then just don't work with them. This has allowed me to manage my time more efficiently, which has lead to higher productivity and a better quality of life.
