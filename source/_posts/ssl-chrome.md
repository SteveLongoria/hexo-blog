With the release of Google Chrome 68 on July 24th, 2018, if your website does not have an SSL Certificate (HTTPS) then Google Chrome will start showing your website visitors a 'Not Secure' message next to the address bar. See below for an example!

The easiest and cheapest solution to this problem is to simply sign-up for a free [Cloudflare.com](cloudflare.com) account and use their free SSL certificate. Oh yea, don't forget to implement 'Forced SSL' like I explain in [this blog post](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/30/forced-ssl/).

Now stop what you're doing and go set this up now so your next website visitor doesn't see the Chrome 'Not Secure' message!
