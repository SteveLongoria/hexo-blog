You're setting up your Google Ad Search Campaign and under the Networks > Search Networks section you are confronted with a blue check box. You need to decide if you should "Include Google search partners' network.

First of all *what does this mean*?

If you leave this box checked, your ads will show up on Google search and other search engines like AOL.com, Ask.com and a whole slew of other search engines.

To start, I recommend leaving this box unchecked so your ads only show up on Google search. After you have your campaign dialed in it doesn't hurt to experiment with more search volume by including these Google search partners. 

The reason I do this is because I like to scale campaigns slowly and Google search is going to give you the bulk of your traffic anyways. Traffic quality is also typically higher with the Google search network compared to their partner sites.
