These days there are a million startups trying to make proposal creation easier for freelancers and agencies alike.

There's a lot to choose from and they all will have you spending a good chunk of change every month.

They can also be rather complicated to set up, involve contracts (I don't use contracts unless it's work I got from Upwork), and sometimes even take a percentage per transaction.

Until recently I had been just using a template in Google Docs for creating my proposals. It's free and it looked good enough.

Lately, though I've thought of ways to make my proposals look a bit more 'snazzy'. I want to give prospective clients more of that WOW factor when I hand over my proposal.

That's when I stumbled across [these awesome Webflow proposal templates][1]. I'm already using Webflow for my website so I figured this would be perfect!

I also create a PDF version simply by taking screenshots of the online proposal and putting them together using the Canva Proposal Template. This isn't really necessary in my opinion but I figure it couldn't hurt.

Now, I won't claim this will be a print-worthy PDF but I know it will look good when viewing on a computer.

**Pro tip**: You can hyperlink elements in your Canva design so that when clicked on they'll take the reader wherever you want to take them.

_So how many more clients are these templates helping me close?_

I've only used it now for one prospect. I was able to close the deal and start the contract with this prospect, but I don't know how much could be attributed to the fancy new proposal.

I know it doesn't hurt especially if you do digital-based work of any kind.
