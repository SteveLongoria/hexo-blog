When you first start your blog, you need to first decide whether or not you're going to use a static site generator (SSG) or if you should use something more traditional like Wordpress.

There are a lot of static site generators out there to choose from. Among the most popular are Hugo, Hexo and Jekyll. This blog is built using Hexo in fact.

Here are my top 3 reasons for choosing a static site generator for blogging instead of Wordpress:

## Reason #1: Fast as fuck

Out of the box, your blog made with a static site generator will load in less than a second. This is before any optimizations are made. This is of course great for SEO and conversions. I talk more about the topic in [this blog post](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/09/11/is-wordpress-best-blogging-platform-for-seo/).

Find me a Wordpress blog with this kind of page speed. 

## Reason #2: More secure

Static site generators are more secure compared to their Wordpress counterparts as well. This is because there are fewer attack vectors. There is no database to worry about getting hacked. 

The fact of the matter is Wordpress is like Windows in that it's a huge target for hackers because so many people use them.

## Reason #3: Easier to customize theme

You only need to know markdown, html, CSS, and some JS to make almost any customization to the theme. Creating a theme from scratch is much more trivial than it is with Wordpress. 

There's no server-side functionality for contact forms or comments but there are other easy ways to achieve the same functionality. 

You can wire up your form to work with [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com), [Drip](https://drip.com) or [Formspree](https://formspree.io). You could simply use [Typeform](https://typeform.com) for your contact form. For comments, you can just implement [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments into your static blog. 

If you want to sell digital products there are also a plethora of options as well. None of which require you to have server-side functionality. 

If you want to create sales pages instead of blog posts, use [carrd.co](https://carrd.co) on a sub-domain.
