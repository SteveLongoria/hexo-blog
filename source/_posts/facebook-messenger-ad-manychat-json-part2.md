If you missed Part I of this post [click here](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/08/14/facebook-messenger-ad-manychat-json-growth-tool/). We're going to continue right where we left off!

In a new tab, open up your Facebook Ad Manager and create a new Ad campaign. Choose “Messages” campaign type here:

Next, name your campaign and choose which action you most want to measure, you can leave this as “Link Clicks”:

Next, name your Ad Set. This can be anything that will help you identify the Ad Set targeting used in that particular Ad Set. For Example, “18+, Landlord, Tempe, AZ”

Choose where you want to drive traffic, obviously we want Messenger for this campaign:

Choose your audience targeting just like any other Facebook Ad campaign. It’s good to experiment a lot here to see what works best for your business and your city.

Even try breaking down the Ad Set to target one suburb each. This way you can see which suburb is giving you a better cost per new messenger conversation.

You can even have your ad only show up to people who have visited your site and didn’t take action, this is called Remarketing.

There’s a lot that can be said about audience targeting and this guide is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on audience targeting, but I do know what works for one business doesn’t always work for another so it’s important to test, test, test!

For ad placements, you always want to select news feed as that's where the bulk of your conversions are likely to happen. If you keep set to Automatic Placement, Facebook will post your ad in the right column and other various places that don't work as well.

Set your budget. This varies from business to business:

Click continue to move on to the next page to set up the ad!

On the next page, go ahead and name your ad something that will help you identify it:

Next up, select an image for your ad. For this example we’re just using a single image, but you should test all different types of imagery here, even video!

Fill in your ad copy and select your CTA button copy, I just leave it as “Send Message”:

Next, scroll down until you see the “Message Setup’ section. Click “JSON”. Now, we need to hop back over to our tab where we have ManyChat Growth Tool open:

Click on the ‘Setup’ link just to the right of “Opt-In Actions’ link:

You’ll then see all of our JSON code:

Go ahead and click the “Copy Code to Clipboard” link to copy all of the code. After that, hop back over to the Facebook Ad Manager tab you have opened and paste the JSON code into the “Message Setup JSON” section:

Click “Confirm” to submit the ad for approval and that’s it! Go ahead and test out your ad to make sure it’s functioning like it’s supposed to and you’re in business! :) Now, to add scarcity to your Messenger sequence, put together a limited-time offer sequence and [follow this guide to integrate your ManyChat with DeadlineFunnel.com countdown timer](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/525-how-to-integrate-deadline-funnel-with-manychat).
