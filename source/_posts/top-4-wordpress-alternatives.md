Wordpress is great, but when it comes to blogging these days there are better options in my humble opinion. 

Here are my top 4 Wordpress alternatives you should check out today!

## [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

Ghost is an open-source, non-profit blogging platform built using the NodeJS server-side language.

The main benefit to using Ghost is security and speed.  [Independent tests](https://ghost.org/vs/wordpress/) have shown it to be up to 1900% faster than Wordpress.

It's more secure by nature simply because it's not as popular as Wordpress and not as many hackers aren't targeting the platform like they are Wordpress. 

It's kind of like how the Windows operating system has more viruses and security exploits than OSX and Linux. I've been known to call Wordpress the "Windows Of Blogging Platforms" for this reason.

Ghost is also optimized for SEO and Social Media out of the box which means you don't have to fuss around with plugins just to start publishing your blog.

Since Ghost offers hosting, which goes to support their non-profit organization, it's a lot easier to get setup and blogging without having to worry about finding a hosting provider and installing Wordpress. All in all it's just a much simpler and more enjoyable blogging experience in my opinion.

I'm currently using Ghost on my site [varpop.com](https://varpop.com)! :)

I find modifying and creating Ghost themes a lot more straight forward as a front-end web developer since the view is separated from the logic, unlike Wordpress. 

I can also use Git version control with my Ghost theme development.

## [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

As much as I love Ghost, if I were to create a new blog today, it would probably be using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/). Hugo is what's called a 'static site generator'. Basically this means your blog no longer needs a database or server-side language because it's static, not dynamic. There's obviously a lot more to it than that, but that is the "eli5".

The benefits of this are speed, security and affordability. 

Your Hugo blog doesn't need to query a database, because of this it's able to load lightning fast. We're talking less than a second fast out of the box.

Most security exploits are done through a website's database, therefore not having a database provides a huge layer of security for your Hugo blog, making it much more difficult to hack.

Again, because your Hugo blog has no database, you're able to host it via Github pages for FREE, this includes having your own custom domain name for your blog too. This is pretty huge because this allows you to have a very low cost startup and only scale once you've built up traffic and an audience.

Hugo comes with a bunch of [awesome themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to plugin and tweak until your heart's content.

## [Hexo](https://hexo.io)

Hexo is similar to Hugo in that it's a static site generator so it comes with most of the same benefits as Hugo, only Hugo claims to be faster. I have yet to test this for myself. 

I'm currently using Hexo for this very blog you're reading right now! The theme is in early development so it is minimal on purpose.

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

This is another static site generator like the last two, except unlike the last two it uses Ruby On Rails. It has a huge community and is older than Hexo and Hugo so it's worth a mention!
