You spent a lot of time and energy creating your new digital product. You want to do everything in your power to prevent people from pirating your new product. This is completely understandable and I totally get why a product owner would not want people to steal or pirate their product. If everybody did it then you'd have no customers right?

The truth is, it's very difficult to combat piracy online. Anybody can purchase your product, make digital copies and share it with whomever they want and there's very little you can do about it.

Is it even a battle worth fighting? Take for example the HBO show Game Of Thrones. It was HBO's most torrented show in history, yet it was still HBO's most profitable show to date as well. How is that possible?

It's because people who pirate your product were never your potential customers. They were never going to purchase your product in the first place. But since they were able to pirate it, they may still spread the word about your product to somebody who DOES happen to purchase digital products online and somebody that DOESN'T believe in piracy.

I'm not saying you should try to make it easier for the pirates but I also wouldn't spend too much effort in fighting it either. Some payment processors like Gumroad will 'stamp' each customer's info on PDF downloads automatically. This should help to deter piracy for any product you have that is in PDF format.
