Almost every local business experiences this, some more than others. Your business has countless happy customers but you wouldn't know it from looking at your Google star rating.

It's unfortunate but unhappy customers are just more vocal than happy customers usually.

I know it sucks, but it's just the nature of local business in our modern digital age. It's vital that every business is more proactive in collecting reviews from happy customers.

In today's post I'm going to give you a strategy that you can employ in your business today to start getting more positive reviews from happy customers which will bring your Google star rating back up to 4 or 5 stars.

First off, why is it important for your local business to have a 4-5 star Google rating?

Please understand I'm not trying to argue the validity of the negative reviews. When I've spoke with small business owners in the past about their Google rating, they'd start trying to argue with me about how the customer was in the wrong. I'm not here to argue this, the customer may very well be in the wrong, that is neither here nor there. 

The bottom line is that if you're not proactive in collecting and managing your Google reviews, it will cost your business serious money when you slip below a 4 or 3 star rating.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about how you can start to reverse this trend and turn your 3 star rating into a 5 star rating!

## Step 1: Install this free review portal page on your website

-Print out business card sized flyers to give to each customer after each purchase
-Include it on your receipts!
