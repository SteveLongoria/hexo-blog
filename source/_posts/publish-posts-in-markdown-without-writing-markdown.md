Not everyone likes to write [Markdown][1]. You either love it or hate it. I've been using Hexo Static Site Generator for my blog over the past several months and this means I've had to learn Markdown.

It's easy enough to learn but there's just something about it that I didn't like. I couldn't put my finger on it.

The best way I can explain it is that it made me less excited about drafting new blog posts and I noticed this lead to me dragging my feet on several occasions.

I prefer to draft my posts in [Grammarly][2]. It helps me spot spelling mistakes and errors in grammar. It's a simple document app with your basic choices for formatting and styling your text.

You can highlight text and make it bold, give it emphasis, set up ordered lists and unordered lists.

You can quickly create hyperlinks. It's basically like a simple version of Google Docs with better grammar and spellcheck.

It always sucked having to manually convert my finished posts into Markdown to publish via Hexo.

Fortunately, I found a Chrome Extension called [Grammarly to Markdown][3] that automatically converts your Grammarly document into Markdown and copies it to your clipboard to paste wherever you want.

It has served me very well and I highly recommend checking it out!
