I’ve audited a lot of Google Search Ad campaigns throughout the years that were just sending their paid traffic to their homepage. Their homepage of course was a ‘corporate brochure’ type of website with many call to actions and navigation links. 

They may even have an atrocious auto image carousel (link to my blog post about this) as well. This is a great way to flush your money down the drain.

If you want to see a dramatic lift in your Google Ad campaign performance, you really want to send your traffic to a landing page with one specific offer and one call to action. 

Not only is this better for conversions but it allows you to perform faster, more accurate a/b split-tests to see exactly what’s making you money and what isn’t.

Go ahead and give it a shot!
