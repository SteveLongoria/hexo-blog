So you've decided you want to become a freelancer, but there's just one thing holding you back, you feel like you have zero skills. Also, what should you call yourself? A web designer? A web developer? A digital marketer? What service should you provide? 

There's a million questions and concerns going through your head right now, keeping you from taking action. You doubt your abilities so you don't even start. Yet, you can stop thinking 'what if?'.

I'm here to say it's possible to make your freelance dream a reality. I have and if I can do it, seriously anybody can. I have no special education and everything I know I learned from doing it myself or researching how others did it online. 

Here's some actionable advice to get you started. You can filter gigs on Upwork so you only see job postings looking for entry-level talent. Bid low to get the job, then learn how to do the task while getting paid to learn. Build up some reviews and start raising your price and searching for gigs for more experienced applicants.

By no means should you stay exclusively on Upwork as it's never good to put all of your eggs in one basket, but it's a start!

Just remember, expertise and skill are relative. We're all constantly learning and constantly sharpening our skillset. Don't let lack of experience keep you from taking action and don't be afraid to fail!

That's how I got my start. I created a Wordpress blog about music called RisingFist.com. At its peak, it was generated roughly 500 visitors a day from Google and other traffic sources. I didn't make much money from the site however and so many would call this a failure.

This couldn't be further from the truth. The experience I gained allowed me to kickstart my freelance career and 10 years later it's hard to see that first website as a failure considering how far I've come and how much money I've made in my freelance career.

I'll leave you with one of my favorite business quotes:
