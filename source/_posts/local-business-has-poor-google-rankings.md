I recently had a family member reach out and ask how they can improve their Google SEO for a local pain treatment center. Getting traffic and patients from Google can be difficult to say the least, it becomes even more confusing when you realize the approach you take as a small, local business is going to be different than a business that is targeting the whole country (or world).

So what should your Google SEO strategy be as a small, local business?

I’d suggest the following:

1. Use [BrightLocal.com](https://www.brightlocal.com) local citation building service. There are countless local business directories online, and this service helps you to claim all of them and manage your business info on all of them easily and quickly. This is important so there isn't conflicting business info across these local business directories which can have a negative effect on your SEO.

2. Become proactive getting positive google reviews from happy customers. With local SEO, your Google star rating and review count has a serious effect on your Google ranking. Just by focusing in this area a business can gradually start to see an increase in their Google rankings and organic search traffic.

3. Make sure your homepage title tag is targeting your main keyword. In the case of this pain treatment center, they'd want to put "Pain Treatment Center [City]" in their title tag. You don't want to stuff too many keywords here and it's really best to focus on one or two of your most important keywords.

The above is the long term play for organic Google traffic. This doesn’t happen overnight and there are no guarantees. This is why in the short-term I’d recommend a Google Ad campaign to start showing up immediately under your desired keywords.
