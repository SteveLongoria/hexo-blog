Making money from your blog is a long hard slog. In fact, according to [this survey](https://blogging.org/blog/blogging-stats-2012-infographic/) from 2012, 81% of bloggers never even make $100 throughout the entire life of their blog. Ouch!

I feel like I'd be doing you all a disservice by not telling you about a little known platform called [Steemit.com](https://steemit.com) that I've blogged on and earned some xtra money from.

In fact, as my post title states, I made $754.75 from just one blog post in particular. You can [see that post here on Steemit](https://steemit.com/food/@steveo/let-s-turn-suburbia-into-a-local-food-mecca).

I'll be honest though, most of my posts over there are lucky to earn just $3 and my energies have been focused elsewhere lately so I've been posting less on Steemit, but your mileage may vary!

Go make an introduction post on [Steemit.com](https://steemit.com) and let me know how much you make.

By no means should you stop building your business or blog, but xtra money is xtra money right?
