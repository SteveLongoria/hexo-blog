When you're creating a Google Ad campaign, you're asked to select a goal for your campaign.

These options have many scratching their head, wondering what goal they should select for their ad campaign. What happens if you select the wrong one!?

Have no fear, this is not a big deal. It's pretty self explanatory, go ahead and choose the goal of your campaign. 9 times out of 10 my clients are either trying to generates sales or leads.

I always just select 'Website Traffic' or 'Create a campaign without a goals guidance' as I like to create "conversions" for the campaign separately inside the Google Ad dashboard here:

The reason I do this is because I don't want Google's algorithms making any decisions for me. I turn off any campaign automation anyways, I want to make all adjustments to the campaign manually. 

Rest assured that you'll still be able to track sales conversions and lead conversions for your campaign even though you're not clicking the 'Sales' goal or 'Leads' goal here in this step of the campaign creation process.
