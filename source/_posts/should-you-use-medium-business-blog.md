I used to advocate for just using [Medium](https://medium.com) for your business blog so you have less stuff to maintain and so you can just focus on your product and sales. I was convinced partly by [Jason Fried's article here](https://m.signalvnoise.com/signal-v--noise-moves-to-medium/) on why he switched Basecamp's blogging over to Medium.

I've completely changed my mind over the past 2 years, however. I now regret not starting with my own business blog from day one and here's why:

## Reason #1

It removes the 'face' of your content. I believe [Josh Pigford describes it best here](https://baremetrics.com/blog/medium-back-to-blog) when he says "It neutralizes all content to basically be author-agnostic. It’s like Walmart or Amazon in that you can buy from thousands of different brands, but you rarely actually know what brand you’re buying... you just know 'I got it from Amazon.'"

So basically whenever somebody reads your content on Medium all they remember is "I read this on Medium" which is definitely not what you want.

## Reason #2

When you're publishing on Medium instead of your own blog property you're building up somebody else's asset and not your own.  You're better off, in the long run, publishing your content on your own blog so you'll receive more organic Google traffic going directly to your website and not Medium.com. 

So does this mean you shouldn't publish on Medium.com at all? Probably not, but if you do, just be sure to publish content on your own blog first. Then, after it's indexed by Google, feel free to publish the same content on Medium. 

Even that might take some traffic away from your blog if your Medium version starts to rank higher than your blog version, however. To be on the safe side and to ensure my blog always receives the organic traffic going to my content, I personally don't publish on Medium anymore.

Your mileage may vary of course! [I'd love to hear](https://twitter.com/stevelongoria) what your experience has been on this topic.
