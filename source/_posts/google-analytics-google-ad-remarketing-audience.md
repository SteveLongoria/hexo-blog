I had a client recently who needed help creating an 'audience' of website visitors who didn't fill out his web form. He wanted to use this audience for a [Google Ad Remarketing Campaign][1] which is a pretty common digital advertising strategy these days simply because the return on investment is typically a lot higher than a traditional ad campaign.

It can be a little confusing trying to set this up with Google Ads which is why I figured I'd draft up a short blog post about it. It is possible to [set up a remarketing audience natively in Google Ads][2] but it's only going to build your audience from visitors who came from a Google Ad.

The main advantage of setting up your remarketing audience in Google Analytics is the ability to build your audience from all website visitors whether they came from organic search, paid search, social media, email, instant message, word of mouth, etc.

Once you define your remarketing audience in Google Analytics, you can simply share it with your Google Ad account to use for any of your paid search, shopping, display, or Youtube ad campaigns.

**Ready to get started?**

After you login to your Google Analytics account and access the property you're wanting to use to set up your remarketing audience, go ahead and click the 'admin' link at the bottom left corner of the screen.

It has a little gear icon next to it and looks like this:

You'll then be presented with 3 columns; Account, Property and View. We're going to bring our attention to the second column; Property:

Go ahead and click the big red 'New Audience' button and we'll create a new audience based on all website visitors except the ones who have submitted our lead generation form.

Next, we'll start filling out the info for our new remarketing audience. The first step is selecting the view:

Enter the URL for your 'thank you' page without your root level domain like this:

Enter the membership duration you want for this audience. This is how long they'll be part of this audience so if it is set for 30 days for example, after 31 days they will not be in your audience anymore and therefore can't be remarketed to. If the sales cycle is shorter for your product or service you may want to reduce the membership duration. If the sales cycle is longer, you may want to increase it!
