Google Adwords, or [Google Ads as they want to be called now](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9028765?hl=en), has recently [made some big changes to their user interface over the past year](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6383306?hl=en).

Some people love it and some hate it. I personally prefer the older interface but I understand that with technology you must be willing and able to adapt to change, because it's happening all the time!

One of the first questions that may arise when starting your first Google Ad campaign is, "Well, how do I start the creation process?".

It's easy! After logging into into your Google Ads account, click the big blue button with a plus sign on it and your off to the races!
