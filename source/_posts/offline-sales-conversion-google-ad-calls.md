When you're running a Google Search Ad campaign for a business that is handling sales offline over the phone or in person it's difficult to accurately track your ROI to the ad and keyword level, which is crucial if you want to optimize your Google Search Ad campaign to maximize your ROI.

Fortunately, Google launched their ['Offline Sales Conversion Tracking'](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2998031?hl=en) in 2015 which enables you to track offline sales to the ad and keyword level. What does this mean? It means we're able to determine exactly which location, ad, keyword, time of day, day of week and device (mobile, desktop, tablet) is generating the best cost per SALE, not just the best cost per CALL. This is the holy grail, because once we know which location, ad, keyword, time of day, day of week and device is generating the lowest cost per sale, we can adjust bids accordingly to increase our ROI. For example, let's say we notice most of our sales our coming from our ads running on desktop computers vs mobile. We can make a percentage bid adjustment on all mobile devices, for this example let's say a 50% reduction in bid for anybody searching on a mobile device. This means if our bid for a given keyword is $5, when somebody searches on a mobile device our bid will automatically be dropped by 50%. We want to pay less for mobile clicks if they don't convert as well after all.

I made a [post last week about tracking offline sales from Google Search Ad clicks](https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/10/02/offline-sales-conversion-google-ad-click/) to a landing page where the visitor then fills out a form for more information or a 'free quote/free consultation' etc. This week I'm going to explain how to do this for Google Search Ad calls, calls coming directly from the ad or from the Call Ad Extension.

<h3>Setting Up Offline Sales Conversion Tracking For <u>Calls</u></h3>

For calls you simply need a call tracking CRM system that automatically tracks time of call for each lead. You need to be able to provide the info found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T1kh6koOeoPxww20s3aRYv6jZhW70O2ZG9ciyx6H7iU/edit#gid=1008980182), then you upload this data to Google Ads so they can connect the dots. If you're looking for a solution in this area, try [CallRail](https://www.callrail.com/) integrated with a CRM like [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/).

Now go give this a shot yourself and let me know how you fare! :)
