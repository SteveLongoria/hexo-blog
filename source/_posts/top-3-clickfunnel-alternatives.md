I come across quite a few marketers wanting to use Clickfunnels and really I have nothing against that. If they want to rock Clickfunnels and they get great results all the power to them.

For a lot of marketers and entrepreneurs however, the price of Clickfunnels is just a little too steep. You're looking at a minimum of $97/mo.

[Page speed also leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to Clickfunnels](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=clickfunnels.com).  Why does that matter? [This is why](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/).

So in this article, I present to you the top 3 Clickfunnel alternatives.

## [Carrd.co](https://carrd.co)

I recently stumbled across this landing page builder and was blown away at the price. If you want full functionality, which includes Stripe payments integration with their forms, you're only looking at $49/year. 

The pages created by [Carrd](https://carrd.co) load fast as well.

## [Webflow](https://webflow.com)

I've been playing around with this site builder lately and I have to say I'm impressed. The end product loads fast and the pricing is reasonable for what you get. You can even have a blog attached so this which would be a replacement for any blogging platform you were considering as well.

## HTML & CSS Flexbox

Last but not least, you could always code up your own pages using good ol' HTML and CSS Flexbox for mobile responsiveness. You can host them for free using Netlify.com. There are a lot of great templates out there to get you started so you don't have to start from scratch either. 

Here are a couple of my favorites that I've used:

- [Responsive Landing Page Template With Flexbox](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/freebie-landing-page-template-with-flexbox)
- [CSS Flexbox One Page Template w/ Sticky Menu](https://codepen.io/RomanKl/pen/LWmvOK)

If you're looking for resources for learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I recommend checking out [MDN's Learn Web Development Online Course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web).

## Conclusion

With all 3 of these alternatives, you'll likely need your own email marketing automation software like Drip.com, Convertkit.com or something similar.
